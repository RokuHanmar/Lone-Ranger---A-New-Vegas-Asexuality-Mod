# Lone-Ranger---A-New-Vegas-Asexuality-Mod
This mod adds a new perk, Lone Ranger to Fallout New Vegas. Lone Ranger prevents the player from taking the Black Widow, Lady Killer, Confirmed Bachelor or Cherchez la Femme perks. In return, version 1.0.3 will allow the player to deal 10% damage to all human enemies at the cost of the unique dialogue and opportunities presented by the aforementioned perks. Contrastingly, versions 1.0.4 and 1.0.5 will grant the player an extra 10% damage threshold to all attacks coming from a human enemy.


Manual Installation:

1. Head to \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas\Data
2. Extract the archive, placing the esp file in the Data folder
3. If you're using a mod manager, make sure the plugin is enabled. In MO2, this is done by scrolling through the menu on the right hand side and clicking the box. You'll know it's enabled when you see a tick


Changelog:
1. Created version 1.0.5, which dummies out perks such as Black Widow (2025-08-19)
